Welcome to my GitHub Repository

This repository showcases the coursework and projects completed during my MSc in Fundamental Principles of Data Science at the Universitat de Barcelona. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio reflecting my academic progress and commitment to mastering core concepts across the diverse fields that make up modern data science.

About the Program

In today’s digital world, vast amounts of data are generated every day—from online transactions and scientific research to financial activity and social media. Without proper analysis, this data remains meaningless. Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to extract insight and value from data by combining techniques from mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

The MSc in Fundamental Principles of Data Science is designed to provide us with a solid theoretical and practical foundation in the mathematical and algorithmic principles that underpin data modeling and analysis. The program is meant to equip students with the skills needed to tackle real-world data challenges, emphasizing the ability to understand, modify, and design algorithms to fit specific problem contexts.

Course content spans a wide range of advanced topics, as can be seen from the files in this repository.
