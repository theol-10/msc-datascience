About the Program

In today’s digital world, vast amounts of data are generated every day—from online transactions and scientific research to financial activity and social media. Without proper analysis, this data remains meaningless. Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to extract insight and value from data by combining techniques from mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

The MSc in Fundamental Principles of Data Science is designed to provide us with a solid theoretical and practical foundation in the mathematical and algorithmic principles that underpin data modeling and analysis. The program is meant to equip students with the skills needed to tackle real-world data challenges, emphasizing the ability to understand, modify, and design algorithms to fit specific problem contexts.

Course content spans a wide range of advanced topics, including:

Computational algebra

Optimization and probabilistic programming

Machine learning and deep learning

Complex networks and recommendation systems

Natural language processing and time series analysis

Image data extraction

Infrastructure support for big data processing
